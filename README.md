The file 'CoCo-GAN'introduces a game theoretic regularization of Wasserstein GAN.

The file 'Fibrations explain all you need!' introduces fibrations as a model for abductive reasoning and as an attention mechanism.

The key idea here is to treat being a fibration not as a property, but as structure.

Our fibration definition does not use a universal property - a property of some construction which boils down to (is manifestly equivalent to) the property that an associated object is a universal initial object of some (auxiliary) category.
 
Instead we introduce lifting structures.  One consequence of shifting to a structured definition is that notions of fibration which are logically equivalent as properties are no longer isomorphic as structures.  This leads to the imposition of compatibility conditions on liftings. 

So we trade imposition of universality, a form of optimization, for structural compatibility, that as we will see informs abductive reasoning and attention mechanisms.  

This curious nuance through shift in perspective finesses trying to conceptualize notions of best plausible explanation consistent with the data.  Moreover, it has a cognitive interpretation for human abduction which employs analogy and heuristics.  

Sidebar:  Perhaps a constructive model of univalent foundations also needs to be structural rather than universal property driven?
